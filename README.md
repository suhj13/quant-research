The file that is focused on is the fast_accurate_summation.py file.
Only this file needs to be run.
Other files in the code directory are for testing purposes.
The fast_accurate_summation.py file is meant to simulate the FastPrecSum algorithm.
Lines 91 to 101 are used to test the FastPrecSum method.
The method takes in two parameters:
    - An array of float16 elements.
    - K value (Ensure 1 < K <= 3>. If K is 1, an error will return. If greater than 3, The value returned will not be precise.)
